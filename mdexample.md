## 💻 A Little Coding for the Road  

This is the bubble sort algorithm, the `len(arr)` checks how many items in the array are.

```py
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Bon voyage! 🚀✨
